# Tuple is almost same as list except the fact that it is IMMUTABLE (contents cannot be changed), while tuple is MUTABLE (contents can be changed)
# All operations possible with list is also possible with tuples except changing contents (append, insert, remove, pop, in-place sort/reverse, etc.)
# Advantage of tuples are its lower memory usage and faster operations

constant_items = (1, 2, "apple", "banana")  # Note '()' instead of list's '[]'
# Contents of 'constant_items' cannot be changed
