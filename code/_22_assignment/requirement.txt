Create a Python server (back-end) application with the following features:

1. Should connect to a database ‘electronic_devices_db’ consisting of only a single table ‘electronic_device_details’
which stores the details of electronic devices. Things to note:
    a. The Python application should create the ‘electronic_devices_db’ database if it does not already exist. If
it does, the existing database should be used.
    b. You are free to define the columns in ‘electronic_device_details’ table.
    c. Index the ‘electronic_device_details’ table based on one or more columns which you think are most
relevant.

2. Should expose 4 APIs for:
    a. Adding a new electronic device to the database.
    b. Updating details of an existing electronic device in the database.
    c. Removing an existing electronic device from the database.
    d. Getting the details of all electronic devices in the database.

3. Should have a thread/timer to constantly monitor whether the number of rows in the ‘electronic_device_details’
table has exceeded a limit. This limit should be read from a file named ‘config.json’.

4. If the number of rows in the ‘electronic_device_details’ table has exceeded the limit, an entry should be written
to a log file named ‘application.log’. The format of the entry should be: <datetime> --- <message>
E.g.
2022-06-08 08:44:08.176 --- Electronic device details table exceeded the limit of 10 rows
